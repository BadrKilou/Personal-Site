# Personal-site
I've built this Portfolio website , in help of promoting myself , it is fullstack i'm running nodejs express js mongo db in the backend , as well as html css & javascript & few libraries in the front end , i spent a quite bit of time building this project , but it is worth it at the end of the day.
